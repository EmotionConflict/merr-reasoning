    "predicted_label": "happy",
    "reasoning": "The visual cue 'dimpler' suggests a smile, which typically associates with happiness. The lack of emotional cues in the audio indicates neutrality in tone, but the smile can imply a positive sentiment. Therefore, considering the visual cue, the most fitting emotion label is happy. "

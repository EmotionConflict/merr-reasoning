However, the visual cue of a \"cheek raiser\" typically indicates a smile, which is often associated with happiness or friendliness. Considering these cues, the overall emotion represented here seems to be a contradiction between the serious subject matter and the expression of the speaker. Therefore, I would label it as neutral; as they are communicating a serious topic while maintaining a calm demeanor with a hint of a smile."

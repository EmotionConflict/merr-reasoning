    "predicted_label": "neutral",
    "reasoning": "The phrase 'So, tell mom, what are your plans?' does not convey any strong emotion through the words used. The audio cues suggest that the person is speaking in a neutral tone without any of the emotions listed, which aligns with having a dimpler, indicative of a light or casual expression rather than a strong emotional state. Therefore, the overall vibe comes off as neutral."

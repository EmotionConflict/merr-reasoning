SABOTAGE DETECTION ANALYSIS:
----------------------------------------
Formal sabotage cases (confidence >= 70%, ensemble follows wrong modality): 75
Potential sabotage cases (confidence >= 70%, wrong prediction only): 131

Successful sabotages by modality (ensemble followed wrong modality):
  A: 27
  TAV: 25
  V: 9
  T: 14

Top 5 most confident successful sabotages:
  1. sample_00000832.mp4 (A): neutral (conf: 100%) vs angry (GT) - ENSEMBLE FOLLOWED
  2. sample_00004007.mp4 (A): happy (conf: 95%) vs surprise (GT) - ENSEMBLE FOLLOWED
